re-start change log
add purchase and exit buttons
found an error
find (and use) a simple, albiet confuseing, fix
came up with improved version
tried improved version. didin't work
	after rebuilding, it suddenly did.
with that discovery (of it working after a build) decided to try just a re-build of the one without any changes
	that worked. talk about anti climatic...

for some reason, not useing the public variable for the total. seems to not cause issue, changeing anyways.

made a simplified version of the planned function future plan is to utilize the function in a more modular way, where it does the math more in-depth, and allows the price to be stored, not in the tag, but in the name of the buttons (if no cost in button, use tag)
made another function to deal with the if/then parts

make documentation
